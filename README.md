ATtiny based interactive sound device
=====================================

This code implements an ATtiny based device that can be shaken and will give a signal to a second ATtiny chip that will play a sound.

The microcontroller analyzes voltages of an analog accelerometer and recognizes shocks that, when summed up, will be interpreted as a shake.
